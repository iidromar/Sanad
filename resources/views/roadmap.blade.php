                    <div class="time">1. Start With Your Resources</div>
                    <p>A common roadmapping mistake is creating a plan without accounting for the resources<br> required to execute on it and reach a target. In many cases, entrepreneurs quit halfway<br> through or fail to accomplish the desired outcome simply because<br> their time or investment is insufficient.</p>

                    <div class="time">2. Set A Goal And Work Backwards</div>
                    <p>With a clear launch goal such as taking a product to market with ten paying customers,<br> it’s time to create a roadmap that will get you there. Working backwards helps you answer,<br> what steps do we need to take to accomplish this goal?</p>

                <li>
                    <div class="time">3. Control The Input, Not The Output</div>
                    <p>In startups and business in general, many paths can take you to the same destination.<br> No matter the route you take, it’s never going to be linear. Your roadmap will set you off <br>in the right direction and show you the most important stops but<br> will never perfectly predict your journey. Why? Simply because<br> most of your launch steps depend on external factors such the<br> customer and the market.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="time">4. Steps to Success</div>
                    <p>A series of steps you complete in order to move on to the next module. Each step contains concrete,<br> actionable tasks to complete, as well as information to help you. <br>Some steps include recommended homework; your mentor may recommend additional work. </p>

                    <div class="time">5. Resources</div>
                    <p>Information and resources, including tools, templates, and online workshops, <br>to help you learn more or complete the steps in that module.</p>

                <li>
                    <div class="time">6. Creating a Startup Strategy Roadmap the Jibility Way</div>
                    <p>In the early stages, these challenges often revolve around funding, establishing your <br>first MVP of the product and finding the right founding team.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="time">7. Prioritize and sequence your initiatives </div>
                    <p>With your initiatives established, it’s time to create your roadmap. Start with a simple <br>grid. On the vertical, create your themes, e.g. sales and marketing,<br> product development, funding. Across the top, map out your horizons, e.g. years, quarters, stages.</p>
